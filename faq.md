#### What will be the first public block?

We focus on a managed ramp-up of the SunCoin network to monitor and be ready for the public release. 

The first SunCoin node will be started on 22 March 2018 and followed by additional SunCoin nodes on 23/24 March 2018. Only one cpu miner will be active till the public release of the SunCoin network. All block earnings (based on the cpu miner) during this timeframe are part of the 4% premine. 

Based on the managed ramp-up, the first public block should be ~1728 (this is a calculated value - expected to be different / lower based on the cpu mining focus).     

#### What is the premine used for?

- Development and Operations (DevOps)
- Marketing & Bounties
- Masternode Pre-Sale & Auction
- Community Support  

#### Will masternodes be available for sale?

- Pre-Sale: Have your masternode running on day one, we offer a limited number (max 6) of masternode packages including VIP support.

- Auction: Limited number (max 4) of masternode packages will be avialable via auction - announced shortly after the release.
